How I completed task number 9:
- I created two virtual machines on AWS: first with opened 8080 port and installed Jenkins, second with installed nginx. 

- I have added "Publish Over SSH" and "Telegram Bot" plugins to Jenkins.

- After that, I created in Jenkins a job that deploy web-site from GitHub  to nginx-server, make test and send notification in Telegram.
